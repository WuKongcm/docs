**Telegram Account Age**

The system will check users' Telegram accounts to determine the account creation date. The older the account, the more Wk tokens will be received.

For every year your account has existed, you move up one level (e.g., 1 year = Level 1, 5 years = Level 5).

_\*Telegram Age Leveling System:_

* **1 year = Lv 1** (0/60,000)
* **2 years = Lv 2** (0/70,000)
* **3 years = Lv 3** (0/80,000)
* **4 years = Lv 4** (0/90,000)
* **5 years = Lv 5** (0/100,000)
* **6 years = Lv 6** (0/110,000)
* **7 years = Lv 7** (0/120,000)
* **8 years = Lv 8** (0/130,000)
* **9 years = Lv 9** (0/140,000)
* **10 years = Lv 10** (0/150,000)

Each level allows you to earn **Wk tokens** per second, starting from 1 Wk at Level 1 and increasing by 1 Wk per second with each additional level.
